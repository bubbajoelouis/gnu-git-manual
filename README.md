 <h1>üö®PROJECT ON HOLD üö®</h1>
<h2>This project is ON HOLD because the GNU Manual Manual (GNU Standards) explicitly points to the GNU Bison Manual as the gold standard. That‚Äôs a problem.</h2>

<h3>I find the GNU Bison Manual to be a brilliant, frustrating, tedious, essential, over-explanatory, under-explanatory, self-indulgent, hyper-pedantic, repetitive, and condescendingly educational bureaucratic masterpiece.</h3>

<h3>Git isn't worthy of such a work of art.</h3>



<h2>Why the GNU Git Manual Will Never Exist</h2>
<h3>Here‚Äôs the actual first paragraph of the GNU Bison Manual:</h3>

<h2>"In order for Bison to parse a language, it must be described by a context-free grammar. This means that you specify one or more syntactic groupings and give rules for constructing them from their parts. For example, in the C language, one kind of grouping is called an ‚Äòexpression‚Äô. One rule for making an expression might be, ‚ÄúAn expression can be made of a minus sign and another expression.‚Äù Another would be, ‚ÄúAn expression can be an integer.‚Äù As you can see, rules are often recursive, but there must be at least one rule which leads out of the recursion."</h2>

<h3>Now, here‚Äôs an <b>equally-terrible</b> opening paragraph for Git following the same formula:</h3>

<h2>"In order for Git to effectuate version control over a repository, it is imperative that the repository be structured in a well-defined and logically consistent manner. Specifically, Git employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to represent a sequence of immutable snapshots, herein referred to as commits. Each commit embodies the state of the repository at a particular moment and is uniquely identified by a cryptographic hash, ensuring both referential integrity and deterministic retrieval.

Commits are not isolated entities but instead participate in a hierarchical lineage, where each commit‚Äîexcept in the base case‚Äîreferences one or more antecedent commits. This recursive relationship establishes what is conventionally described as the commit history. The most primitive form of a commit, known as the initial commit, lacks predecessors and serves as the foundational element from which all subsequent revisions derive.

To illustrate, consider a software project in which a new commit is instantiated via the act of persisting modifications to the repository. Such a commit, by necessity, incorporates a reference to its immediate predecessor(s), thereby extending the directed graph while maintaining its fundamental acyclic nature. Alternatively, in the case of an uninitialized repository, the commit in question assumes the role of the initial commit and, as such, lacks antecedent references.

It follows, then, that a repository‚Äôs state is invariably reducible to a sequence of commits, each of which contributes incrementally to the overall revision history. As is the case with all well-defined recursive structures, there exists a requisite base case‚Äînamely, the initial commit‚Äîwhich serves as the termination condition for backward traversal. Consequently, every repository necessarily contains at least one commit, thereby satisfying the foundational requirement of historical continuity."</h2>

<h2>Is this really how the GNU Git Manual should start?</h2>

Gimme a break.

This is why there is no GNU Git Manual.

# Git for Man and Machine
*A GNU Git Manual, written in the spirit of classic Linux HOWTOs*

## What is this?
This project aims to create **the missing manual** for Git‚Äîa guide that explains **not just what to type, but why Git works the way it does**. If you've ever struggled with cryptic error messages, detached HEAD states, or Git rebase nightmares, this manual is for you.

Most Git documentation focuses on **commands**‚Äîwhich is fine if you already know how Git works. But if you're new, or if you want to truly understand **Git‚Äôs mental model**, you need more than just a list of flags.  

This manual is **concept-driven** rather than **command-driven**. It will teach Git **from first principles**, giving you the tools to reason through problems instead of memorizing commands blindly.

---

## Why?
Because **Git is amazing‚Äîbut only once you understand it.**  
Because **the Git man pages are reference materials, not a learning resource.**  
Because **most tutorials either oversimplify Git or throw you in the deep end.**  
Because **old-school HOWTOs had the right idea: explain things in a way that makes sense to both humans and machines.**

---

## Who is this for?
- **Beginners** who want to understand Git properly, not just copy-paste commands.  
- **Intermediate users** who need to untangle messy repositories and bad merges.  
- **Sysadmins & DevOps** who need to wield Git with confidence in production.  
- **Anyone who wants to stop fighting Git and start using it effectively.**
