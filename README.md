# Git for Man and Machine
*A GNU Git Manual, written in the spirit of classic Linux HOWTOs*

## What is this?
This project aims to create **the missing manual** for Git—a guide that explains **not just what to type, but why Git works the way it does**. If you've ever struggled with cryptic error messages, detached HEAD states, or Git rebase nightmares, this manual is for you.

Most Git documentation focuses on **commands**—which is fine if you already know how Git works. But if you're new, or if you want to truly understand **Git’s mental model**, you need more than just a list of flags.  

This manual is **concept-driven** rather than **command-driven**. It will teach Git **from first principles**, giving you the tools to reason through problems instead of memorizing commands blindly.

---

## Why?
Because **Git is amazing—but only once you understand it.**  
Because **the Git man pages are reference materials, not a learning resource.**  
Because **most tutorials either oversimplify Git or throw you in the deep end.**  
Because **old-school HOWTOs had the right idea: explain things in a way that makes sense to both humans and machines.**

## Who is this for?
- **Beginners** who want to understand Git properly, not just copy-paste commands.  
- **Intermediate users** who need to untangle messy repositories and bad merges.  
- **Sysadmins & DevOps** who need to wield Git with confidence in production.  
- **Anyone who wants to stop fighting Git and start using it effectively.**
